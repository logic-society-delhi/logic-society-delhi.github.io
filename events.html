								Security protocols underpin most aspects of our digital lives nowadays, with finance, health, and even citizenship requiring some online interaction. Mere testing does not suffice for such critical systems, since even one missed test-case could prove to be incredibly costly. So we turn to formal verification, which converts the system into some “abstract” model, casts properties as statements over this model, and then checks if the model satisfies those statements. Formal verification has been done for many security protocols (including TLS, and the Signal messaging protocol) and even found many bugs. The standard verification framework was proposed by Danny Dolev and Andy Yao in a 1983 paper, where the network is assumed to be adversarial, and all communicated messages are modelled as terms in an algebra. We will see a few examples of how this model can be used to find logical flaws in protocols. We recently extended this model to deal with protocols for the internet age which involve certification, by distinguishing between “normal” messages (like encrypted or hashed terms) and “assertions” (statements of the form “this message is an encryption of a 0 or a 1”) using two different algebras. This allows us to better represent such security protocols and avoid human errors in the modelling phase, as well as make the resultant protocol description more readable. We will see some examples of protocols modelled using assertions, and if time permits, briefly discuss that this expressivity comes at no extra cost, i.e. protocol verification is no harder in the presence of an actively malicious adversary in this new model than it was in the original Dolev-Yao model.
