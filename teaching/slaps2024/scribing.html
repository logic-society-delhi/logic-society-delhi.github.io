                            Effective academic writing is crucial for communicating complex ideas, advancing knowledge, and participating in scholarly discourse. By developing strong writing skills through tasks like scribing, we can learn to articulate our thoughts clearly, support arguments with evidence, and contribute meaningfully our fields of study. These skills are invaluable not just in academia, but in many professional contexts as well.

                    As a scribe for this course, your task is to create comprehensive, self-contained notes for the lecture assigned to
                    you. These notes will serve as a valuable resource for your classmates and future students. You will combine
                    information from the lecture, lecture slides, reading materials and provided resources, as well as your personal
                    learning to craft a coherent narrative. Include background and motivation for the topic, any caveats or exceptions to
                    main points, and address common misunderstandings or points that may need clarification.<br>
                    <br>
                    Preparation is key. Two days before your assigned lecture, the instructor will provide you with lecture slides or
                    notes, and recommended reference material. Attend the lecture you're scribing to gather all necessary information.
                    Submit the first draft of lecture notes by email to the instructor <span class="bold-text">by 7 PM on the day after the lecture</span> 
                    (Wednesdays for Tuesday lectures, Friday for Thursday lectures). Your classmates, the teaching assistant, and the
                    instructor will add comments and feedback to these notes. Your final draft is due <span class="bold-text">7 PM, six
                    days after the lecture</span> (Mondays for Tuesday lectures, Wednesdays for Thursday lectures). This version should be 
                    polished, comprehensive, and formatted using the provided LaTeX template. You may either download the template 
                    <a href="./slaps_scribing_template.zip">here</a> or duplicate it on Overleaf 
                    <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/bznwyjwtcppx#60055c" target="_blank"">here</a>. Include key figures, detailed
                    proofs, intuitive explanations for complex concepts, and highlights from class discussions. Address all comments and 
                    feedback received from your classmates, teaching assistant, and the instructor. <br>
                    <br>
                    Regularly read other lectures' notes and email your comments, questions, or suggestions for improvement to the
                    instructor. Your feedback will help enhance the quality of the course materials for everyone. We expect to see
                    thoughtful, consistent engagement from all students in this process. The scribing assignment contributes to <span class="bold-text">5% of
                    your total grade</span> for the course. You are welcome to collaborate with your peers as you see fit while preparing
                    your notes. If you encounter questions or issues you can't resolve while scribing, please contact the instructor or TA
                    for assistance.
