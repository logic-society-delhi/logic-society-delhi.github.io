                    The course project for this semester focuses on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, covered in <a href="./lectures.html">Module 3</a>. The project can be in one of the following tracks:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <span class="bold-text">Application:</span> This track invites you to explore the practical use of solvers within your chosen domain, such as domain-specific automated reasoning, software verification, program synthesis, or optimization. You will model the problem in an appropriate theory, set up a framework to solve it, and demonstrate the solver's effectiveness in addressing complex problems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="bold-text">Integration:</span> This track challenges you to connect solvers with other cutting-edge technologies such as large language models, cloud services, or other advanced systems. You will design and implement interfaces that allow seamless communication between the solver and the chosen technology.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="bold-text">Development:</span> This track is for those interested in the creation and enhancement of the solvers themselves. You will delve into the internal workings of solvers, identify areas for improvement, and either extend current solvers or develop new ones from scratch. This track involves implementation, testing on benchmark problems, and optimizing performance.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                                    
                    The project topic must be
                    approved by the instructor. The project can be completed individually or in pairs. Collaboration
                    with individuals from different majors or backgrounds is strongly encouraged. <br>
                    <br>
                    A project proposal is due by <span class="bold-text">September 28</span>. The proposal should include the chosen domain, the specific problem
                    to be solved, a brief outline of the approach, and expected outcomes. Throughout the project duration, two check-ins
                    are required via brief emails summarizing the project status, progress, and any challenges faced. The check-in dates
                    are <span class="bold-text">October 19</span> and <span class="bold-text">November 9</span>. <br>
                    <br>
                    The final submission consists of three main components: a short write-up, codebase, and a poster. The write-up should summarize the 
                    approach and outcomes, including an introduction to the problem, methodology, results and analysis, and conclusions.
                    It should not exceed 5 pages. The codebase should be available on Github as a public repository with appropriate documentation and commit history. 
                    The poster should visually summarize the project, including the key problem statement,
                    main steps of the approach, significant results, and relevant visual aids. Find some guidelines and a sample
                    <a href="./../poster_guidelines.pdf">here</a>. Both of these are due by <span class="bold-text">November 20</span>. The class on 
                    <span class="bold-text">November 28</span> will be used for project presentations. This 10 to 15 minute presentation should cover an
                    introduction to the chosen domain and problem, a brief explanation of SAT/SMT solvers and how they were applied, the
                    methodology used, key results and findings, challenges faced and how they were overcome, and conclusions drawn from
                    the project. <br>
                    <br>
                    The project will be evaluated based on the originality and relevance of the chosen problem, appropriate application of
                    SAT/SMT solvers, depth of analysis, quality of results, and the clarity and effectiveness of the final submission and
                    presentation. <br>
